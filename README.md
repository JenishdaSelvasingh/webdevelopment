**Description**
It's a web application for managing hospitals rooms and determining the patient's priority for isolation. The app provides a centralised hub for managing the patients and planning their distribution across hospitalâ€™s rooms.

It allows nurses to keep track of the patients and their diseases in real time and to have an overview over the patients and rooms, and better manage the rooms assignment across patients.
